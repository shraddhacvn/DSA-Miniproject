# DSA-Miniproject

The aim of this mini project is to develop an inventory management system
for computer parts using the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. The system should allow
users to insert, update, and delete computer parts, as well as perform inorder, postorder, and
preorder traversals of the inventory.
